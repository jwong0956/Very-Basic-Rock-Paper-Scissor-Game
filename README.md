# Very-Basic-Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
A very basic game of Rock Paper Scissor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is to help show at least what I can do for now with the knowledge I currently know. Would be appreciated if there are some changes that can help improve my code.

FINAL UPDATE(0/15/2020):
- Fixed the motivational picture code to be more efficient and not look bad.
- Added a tied counter to count how many ties you made.
- Added tied reset to the reset score button.
- Added one more motivational picture.
- Note: This is the final update. I WILL NOT BE UPDATING THIS ANYMORE. I will maybe come back in the future to revise it or redo the code to make it better. For now this is the end.

UPDATE 2 (9/10/2020):
- Reduced a lot of code clutter to make it look more efficient and less confusing.
- Added a motivational picture button to help you be more motivated to beat the computer.

UPDATE 1 (9/8/2020):
- Added a reset button to reset the score instead of refreshing the page.
- Reduced the code a tiny bit on JavaScript to be less clutter and more neat.
